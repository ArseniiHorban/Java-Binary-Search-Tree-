# Java-Binary-Search-Tree
This project is a basic implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java.  
It was created as part of a university assignment to demonstrate basic data structures and file I/O operations.

## Features

- Add and delete elements in the BST  
- Search for elements  
- Save/load the tree structure to a `.txt` file

Also there is some specific features like:
- Calculate total cost of all the items
- Display items in Preorder/Postorder

## Usage
Compile and run the program using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`, `java`).  
Follow the terminal prompts to interact with the BST
